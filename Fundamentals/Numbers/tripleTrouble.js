// <-- Triple trouble -->

/*
  Write a function which takes two integers num1 and num2 and returns 1 if there is a straight triple of a digit at any place in num1 and also a straight double of the same digit in num2.

  If this isn't the case, return 0.

  Examples
  451999277, 41177722899 -->  1 // num1 has straight triple 999s and num2 has straight double 99s
  1222345, 12345 -->  0 // num1 has straight triple 2s but num2 has only a single 2
  12345, 12345 -->  0
  888, 77 --> 0 // num1 has three '8's, num2 has 2 '7's, but they are not the same digit
  88888, 88888   --> 1 // more than 3 or 2 repetitions also count 
  123123123, 123 --> 0 // '123' is not a single digit
*/

// <-- Solution -->
function tripledouble(num1, num2) {
  const num1str = num1.toString();
  const num2str = num2.toString();

  for (const number of num1str) {
    if (num1str.includes(number + number + number)) {
      if (num2str.includes(number + number)) {
        return 1;
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
