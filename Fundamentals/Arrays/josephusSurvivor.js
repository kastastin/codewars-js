// <-- Josephus Survivor -->

/*
  In this kata you have to correctly return who is the "survivor", ie: the last element of a Josephus permutation.

  Basically you have to assume that n people are put into a circle and that they are eliminated in steps of k elements, like this:

  n=7, k=3 => means 7 people in a circle
  one every 3 is eliminated until one remains
  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence
  [1,2,4,5,6,7] => 3 is counted out
  [1,2,4,5,7] => 6 is counted out
  [1,4,5,7] => 2 is counted out
  [1,4,5] => 7 is counted out
  [1,4] => 5 is counted out
  [4] => 1 counted out, 4 is the last element - the survivor!

  The above link about the "base" kata description will give you a more thorough insight about the origin of this kind of permutation, but basically that's all that there is to know to solve this kata.

// <-- Solution -->
function josephusSurvivor(n, k) {
  const arr = [...Array(n).keys()].map((i) => i + 1);
  let pos = 0;

  while (arr.length > 1) {
    pos = (pos + (k - 1)) % arr.length;
    arr.splice(pos, 1);
  }

  return arr[0];
}
